'multi_graph' reads from a Float32MultiArray topic specified in the .launch file, drawing several graphs from the data it receives.

Message content:
	First value for x-axis (e.g. a timestamp from a message, particularly useful if graphing from simulation not running at realtime)
	All other values for graphing (make sure to specify the correct number of graphs)

Graphs are created with MatPlotLib
