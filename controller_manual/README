"controller_manual" node publishes commands to TIAGo from a gamepad. It was used with an XBox-360 USB controller.

Two modes are available - move-and-look (Start), and arm control (Mode)

Move-and-Look
	Left analogue stick to move the robot base (forwards/backwards/turning)
	Right analogue stick to move the head (up/down/left/right)
	Triggers to move the torso up (L) and down (R)

Arm Control
	Different buttons/axes are used to control different joints as follows:

	Joint		      Gamepad
	  1		Left stick horizontal
	  2		Left stick vertical
	  3		Triggers
	  4		Right stick vertical
	  5		None
	  6		Right stick horizontal
	  7		None


All control is velocity-based, so the current states of the robot (torso height, head positions, arm joint positions) are subscribed to.

A GUI is also provided to show which buttons have been pressed, aiding in debugging.

Inputs are read with the "inputs" library ( https://pypi.org/project/inputs/ ) modified very slightly to remove a bug.
